# TodoNotes

This project aims to get more practical experience with an emphasis on certain libraries and frameworks. The idea is to create a simple TODO app for iOS and Android. TODOs would be stored and synced with a shared Google Drive. A user could share his shared drive and allow another user to add or remove TODOs. 

### Frameworks planned:
- Kotlin Multiplatform

### Libraries planned:
- Ktor
- Koin

### API:
- Google Drive Api
